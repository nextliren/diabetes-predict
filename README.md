As of 2022, there are nearly 130 million people with diabetes in China. The causes of diabetes in China are affected by various factors, such as lifestyle, aging, urbanization, and family inheritance. At the same time, diabetic patients tend to be younger.  Diabetes can lead to cardiovascular, renal, and cerebrovascular complications. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of individuals with diabetes is of great clinical significance. Early genetic risk prediction of diabetes will help prevent the occurrence of diabetes.  According to the "Chinese Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (2017 Edition)", the diagnostic criteria for diabetes are typical diabetes symptoms (polydipsia, polydipsia, polyphagia, unexplained weight loss) and random venous plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/ L or fasting venous plasma glucose ≥7.0mmol/L or 2h plasma glucose after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) loading ≥11.1mmol/L.  In this competition, you need to build a diabetes genetic risk prediction model from the training data set, and then predict whether an individual in the test data set has diabetes, and join us to help diabetic patients solve this "sweet trouble".
